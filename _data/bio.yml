  content:  "Hi! My name is <strong>Tianqi Zhou</strong>. I am a product manager & designer in Ling Inc. (Beijing, China). I’m a creator who has great enthusiasm and determination to make A.I. technology feeling like living beings who speak meaningful words to the users, instead of something too professional to be user-friendly, a marriage of pleasing form and useful functions. I’m also a never-tired explorer with passion and love to find beauties in life, or create them, a quantum physics lover, a zither(a traditional stringed instrument in China) musician, a swimming athlete and a devoted volunteer. No experience in something!? - I would love to learn!"
