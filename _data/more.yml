When I use my cell phone to take a picture through microscope, the picture I took came out with amazing colors and light effects that looked like the moon's surface. So I named the photo series \"Microscopic Moon\". In addition to a variety of plant slices, a larva of mosquitoes was also captured by me.</p>"

As the leader and the programmer of the team, I came up with the idea of  golf playing. And we finally won the first prize with our collaboration efforts.</p>"

However, standing on a subway makes reading difficult, as one hand is tight with the door handle.</p> <p>So I designed a book with a handle, and prototype it with a plastic handle from the milk box. With that special handle, people can use a single hand to firmly hold a book for reading. Besides this, it also made the book easier for people to take out from the shelf. A patent is granted for this invention. </p>"

Therefore, during an education progam launched by PEER (an NGO supporting education in the village), I had a chance to open a seminar on quantum physics for high school kids in Hunan. To make students better understand the materials, I followed Steven Hawking's explanation in his <i>The Grand Design</i>. I made each student to be a 'physicist' in our history and asked them to present what “themself” has done for physics. Students were inspired by such way of teaching and grew their own interests towards quantum physics.</p>"
